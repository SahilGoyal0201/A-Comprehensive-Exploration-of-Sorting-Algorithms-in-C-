# Sorting-Algorithms
*Implementation of 12 Sorting Algorithms in C++*

This is my project in the **Data Structures and Algorithms** course. In this project, I had to implement 12 Sorting Algorithms and write a report about it.

## Implementations
You can find the implementation of Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Binary-Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Shaker Sort, Shell Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Counting Sort, Radix Sort, and Flash Sort in the [sorting-methods](sorting-methods) folder. 

There are comments about complexity and notes about my implementations in each file.
